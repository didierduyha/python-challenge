## Name
Module 3 Challenge - python Challenge

## Description
There are two separate folders: PyBank and PyPoll. Each contain a python file (main.py) and a csv file which the python file uses. For PyBank, the python code calculates certain metrics, for example total months, total value of profit & losses, and greatest changes (increase and decrease). A textfile containing all these metrics is created. For PyPoll, the code counts up the total votes per candidate and calculates the percent of share of the votes of each candidate and the winner of the election. The code produces a textfile containing all this information.

## Usage
###PyBank
This script can be used to read csv files with two columns (i.e., month and profit/loss) and calculate metrics based on that data as mentioned in the description. This could provide useful insight to the financials of the business in question.

###PyPoll
This script can be used to read csv files with three columns (i.e., voter id, county, and candidate that was voted for) and determine total votes, percentage of votes, and the winner of the election. At the risk of overstating, this script could be useful to determine the outcome of the election and announce the winner!
