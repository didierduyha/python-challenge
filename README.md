Module 2 Challenge - VBA Challenge

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Visuals
There are screenshots of the Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm showing the results after running the ticker_vba_script.bas on the sheets. There are three screenshots for each sheet (2018, 2019, and 2020).

## Usage
The script is able to determine the change in price in a year for each individual ticker, the percent change, and the total volume traded within the year. Moreover, the script provides the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and greatest volume traded and the corresponding ticker.

## Authors and acknowledgment
This project was completed alone.
